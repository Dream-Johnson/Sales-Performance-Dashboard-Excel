📊 Clean layout ideal for management insights

This project showcases my ability to:

Clean and structure raw data

Use PivotTables for summarization

Apply sorting and filtering for deeper insights

Design dashboard-ready views useful for decision-makers

💼 Tools Used: Excel, Pivot Tables, Basic Formulas
